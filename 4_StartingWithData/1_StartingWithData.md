#### 1. Presentation of the data

We are studying the species repartition and weight of animals caught in plots in our study area. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column          | Description                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| record_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month           | month of observation               |
| day             | day of observation                 |
| year            | year of observation                |
| plot_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex             | sex of animal (“M”, “F”)           |
| hindfoot_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight          | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus           | genus of animal                    |
| species         | species of animal                  |
| taxon           | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot_type       | type of plot                       |

#### 2. Downloading and importing the data

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file that contains the survey data from figshare, and we will use `read.csv()` to load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`. Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL (“[https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169)”). This source URL downloads a CSV file from figshare. The text after the comma (“data/portal_data_joined.csv”) is the destination of the file on your local machine. You’ll need to have a folder on your machine called “data” where you’ll download the file. So this command downloads a file from figshare, names it “portal_data_joined.csv,” and adds it to a preexisting folder named “data.”

We don't yet have a folder called "data", so we will need to create one first. In fact, we haven't yet explored our *working directory* in much detail, so let's have a quick look. Let's check the current working directory using `getwd`:

```r
getwd()
```

This looks OK for now, but we could also change it using `setwd(...)` (with the new path given inside the brackets). For now, we will use the present working directory and we can create the "data" folder directly from RStudio:

- Find the "Files" tab in the lower right panel (next to "Plots" and "Packages")

- Click on "New folder" and call the new folder "data"

We can now download and then import the data:

```r
download.file(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

# Alternative link to the portal data:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csc-training/da-with-r/master/DataFiles/portal_data_joined.csv
```

This statement doesn’t produce any output because, as you might recall, assignments don’t display anything. If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: `surveys`.

Wow… that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded properly. Let’s check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the function `head()`:

```r
head(surveys)

## Try also
View(surveys)
```

We will come back to the `read.csv()` function call and its arguments in the next session. For now, let's keep on working with the survey data!

#### 3. What are data frames?

Data frames are the *de facto* data structure for most tabular data in R, and what we use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`; in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character and a logical vector.

![](Images/data-frame-png.png?raw=true)

We can see this when inspecting the **str**ucture of a data frame with the function `str()`:

```r
str(surveys)
```

#### 4. Inspecting `data.frame` objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let’s try them out!

- Size:
  - `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of the object)
  - `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
  - `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns
- Content:
  - `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
  - `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows
- Names:
  - `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
  - `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names
- Summary:
  - `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column
  - `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are “generic”, they can be used on other types of objects besides `data.frame`.

**Challenge**

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

- What is the class of the object `surveys`?
- How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
- How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

```r
## * class: data frame
## * how many rows: 34786,  how many columns: 13
## * how many species: 48
```

#### 5. Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the “coordinates” we want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with different classes.

```r
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]   
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]   
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]      
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7] 
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]    
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] 
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the “`-`” sign:

```r
# The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[, -1]

# Equivalent to head(surveys)
surveys[-c(7:34786), ]
```

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:

```r
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

**Challenges**

1. Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset.

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
   
   - Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
   - Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations.
   - Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
   - Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

3. Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

**Answers:**

```r
# 1.
surveys_200 <- surveys[200, ]

# 2.
nrow(surveys)
surveys_last1 <- surveys[34786, ]
tail(surveys)

# (Saving `n_rows` to improve readability)
n_rows <- nrow(surveys)
surveys_last2 <- surveys[n_rows, ]

## 3.
surveys_middle <- surveys[n_rows / 2, ]

## 4.
head(surveys)
surveys_head <- surveys[-(7:n_rows), ]
```

#### 6. Introducing factors

When we did `str(surveys)` we saw that several of the columns consist of integers. The columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`, `plot_type`, … however, are of a special class called `factor`. Factors are very useful and contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data. So we are going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors represent categorical data and often include information on group membership (e.g. whether measurements belong to experimental controls or different treatment groups). They are stored as integers associated with labels and can be either ordered or unordered. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings. Let's have a look at what this means in practice!

The defining feature of a factor is that it can have several *levels*. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For instance, if we wanted to create a factor called "sex" with the levels "male" and "female":

```r
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because `f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is `"male"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()` and you can find the number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```r
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., “low”, “medium”, “high”), it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of analysis. We can first check the current order:

```r
sex
#> [1] male female female male  
#> Levels: female male
```

One way to reorder our levels in the `sex` vector would be:

```r
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex 

# after re-ordering
#> [1] male female female male  
#> Levels: male female
```

In R’s memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but are more informative than integers because factors are self-describing: `"female"`, `"male"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is “male”? You wouldn’t be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels (like the species names in our example dataset).

#### 7. Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use `as.character(x)`.

```r
as.character(sex)
```

In some cases, you may have to convert factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration levels or years) to a numeric vector. For instance, in one part of your analysis the years might need to be encoded as factors (e.g., comparing average weights across years) but in another part of your analysis they may need to be stored as numeric values (e.g., doing math operations on the years). This conversion from factor to numeric is a little trickier. The `as.numeric()` function returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers. One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then to numbers.

Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:

```r
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))

as.numeric(year_fct) # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...

as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct] # The recommended way
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

- We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
- We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
- We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

#### 8. Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor level. Let’s look at the number of males and females captured over the course of the experiment:

```r
## bar plot of the number of females and males:
plot(surveys$sex)
```

![](Images/bar-chart-mf.png?raw=true)

In addition to males and females, there are about 1700 individuals for which the sex information hasn’t been recorded. Additionally, for these individuals, there is no label to indicate that the information is missing or undetermined. Let’s rename this label to something more meaningful. Before doing that, we’re going to pull out the data on sex and work with that data, so we’re not modifying the working copy of the data frame:

```r
sex <- surveys$sex
head(sex)

#> [1] M M        
#> Levels:  F M

levels(sex)
#> [1] ""  "F" "M"

levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
levels(sex)
#> [1] "undetermined" "F" "M"

head(sex)
#> [1] M M undetermined undetermined undetermined
#> [6] undetermined
#> Levels: undetermined F M
```

**Challenge:**

- Rename “F” and “M” to “female” and “male” respectively.
- Now that we have renamed the factor level to “undetermined”, can you recreate the barplot such that “undetermined” is last (after “male”)?

**Answer:**

```r
levels(sex)[2:3] <- c("female", "male")

sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
plot(sex)
```

#### 9. Using `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`

By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e. text) are coerced (= converted) into factors. Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these columns as `character`. To do so, `read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an argument called `stringsAsFactors` which can be set to `FALSE`.

In most cases, it is preferable to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when importing data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data type. Let's comparise the difference between our data read as "factor" vs "character":

```r
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", 
stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)

surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", 
stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)

# Convert the column "plot_type" into a factor
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
```

**Challenges**

1. We have seen how data frames are created when using `read.csv()`, but they can also be created by hand with the `data.frame()` function. There are a few mistakes in this hand-crafted `data.frame`. Can you spot and fix them? Don’t hesitate to experiment!

```r
animal_data <- data.frame(
          animal = c(dog, cat, sea cucumber, sea urchin),
          feel = c("furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
          weight = c(45, 8 1.1, 0.8)
          )

# missing quotations around the names of the animals
# missing entry in the feel column (one of the furry animals)
# missing one comma in the weight column
```

2. Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example? Check your guesses using `str(country_climate)`:
- Are they what you expected? Why? Why not?
- What would have been different if we had added `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when creating the data frame?
- What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the accurate data type?

```r
country_climate <- data.frame(
       country = c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
       climate = c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
       temperature = c(10, 30, 18, "15"),
       northern_hemisphere = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),
       has_kangaroo = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1)
       )

# country, climate, temperature, and northern_hemisphere are factors; has_kangaroo is numeric
# using stringsAsFactors = FALSE would have made character vectors instead of factors
# removing quotes in temperature and northern_hemisphere and replacing 1 by TRUE in the has_kangaroo column
```

The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame. If not, use it to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data entry (for instance, a letter in a column that should only contain numbers).

#### 10. Formatting dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and usable during analyses. Using `str()`, we can confirm that our data frame has a separate column for day, month, and year, and that each contains integer values.

```r
str(surveys)
```

We are going to use the `ymd()` function from the package `lubridate` (which belongs to the `tidyverse`; learn more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). `lubridate` gets installed as part as the `tidyverse` installation. 

When you load `tidyverse`, the core packages (the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded. `lubridate`, however, does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it explicitly with `library(lubridate)`.

Start by loading the required package:

```r
library(lubridate)
```

`ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts it to a `Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the function requires is flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD”.

Let’s create a date object and inspect the structure:

```r
my_date <- ymd("2015-01-01")
str(my_date)
```

Now let’s paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result:

```r
# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
my_date <- ymd(paste("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-")) 
str(my_date)
```

Now we apply this function to the surveys dataset. Create a character vector from the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns of `surveys` using `paste()`:

```r
paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-")
```

This character vector can be used as the argument for `ymd()`:

```r
ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))

#> Warning: 129 failed to parse.
```

We also see a warning for some dates that failed to parse. We'll get to that soon - for now, the resulting `Date` vector can be added to `surveys` as a new column called `date`:

```r
surveys$date <- ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))
#> Warning: 129 failed to parse.

str(surveys) # notice the new column, with 'date' as the clas
```

Let’s make sure everything worked correctly. One way to inspect the new column is to use `summary()`:

```r
summary(surveys$date)

#>         Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu. 
#> "1977-07-16" "1984-03-12" "1990-07-22" "1990-12-15" "1997-07-29" 
#>         Max.         NA's 
#> "2002-12-31"        "129"
```

Something went wrong: some dates have missing values. Let’s investigate where they are coming from.

We can use the functions we saw previously to deal with missing data to identify the rows in our data frame that are failing. If we combine them with what we learned about subsetting data frames earlier, we can extract the columns "year", "month",  "day" from the records that have `NA` in our new column `date`. We will also use `head()` so we don’t clutter the output:

```r
missing_dates <- surveys[is.na(surveys$date), c("year", "month", "day")]

head(missing_dates)

#> year month day
#> 3144 2000 9 31
#> 3817 2000 4 31
#> 3818 2000 4 31
#> 3819 2000 4 31
#> 3820 2000 4 31
#> 3856 2000 9 31
```

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your analyses, how would you deal with this situation?
